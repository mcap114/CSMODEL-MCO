    "# I. Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Netflix Userbase Dataset provides a snapshot of a sample Netflix userbase, showcasing various aspects of user subscriptions, revenue, account details, and activity. Each row represents a unique user, identified by their User ID. The dataset serves as a synthetic representation and does not reflect actual Netflix user data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is synthetically sourced, and as such, any conclusions and insights may not accurately reflect real-world data. \n",

    "\n",

    "## Dataset File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset represents a unique user. Each columns contain various details about the user. The dataset contains a total of 2500 observations (rows) and 10 variables (columns). Each variable provides specific details about the users, enabling analysis of subscription patterns, revenue generation, and user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "***If the dataset is composed of different files that you will combine in the succeeding steps, describe the structure and the contents of each file.***\n",

    "## Dataset Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 10 variables, each representing different user information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User ID: A unique identifier for each user.\n",
    "- Subscription Type: The type of subscription the user has (basic, standard, or premium).\n",
    "- Monthly Revenue: The monthly revenue generated from the user's subscription.\n",
    "- Join Date: The date the user joined Netflix.\n",
    "- Last Payment Date: The date of the user's last payment.\n",
    "- Country: The country where the user is located.\n",
    "- Age: The age of the user.\n",
    "- Gender: The gender of the user.\n",
    "- Device Type: The type of device the user primarily uses to access Netflix (e.g., Smart TV, Mobile, Desktop, Tablet).\n"
